# 💎 Wallet Frontend — Angular 20 Web Application

This is the **frontend interface** for the Wallet System — a digital wallet platform that allows users to register, manage wallets, perform transactions, and view analytics dashboards.  
Built using **Angular 20**, **SCSS**, and **TypeScript**, it provides both **Admin** and **User** portals with a clean and modern UI.

## 🧭 Overview

The **Wallet Frontend** communicates with the backend API (`Wallet.Api`) to display real-time wallet data, transactions, and user details.  
It follows a **modular feature-based structure**, making it scalable, maintainable, and easy to extend with new features.
